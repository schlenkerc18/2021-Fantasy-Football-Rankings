# 2021-Fantasy-Football-Rankings
This project aims to create a 2021 ranking of fantasy football players to help players during their fantasy football draft.

I plan to model my 2021 projections based on several factors including statistics from previous seasons, coaching staff, offensive-line ranking, etc.  I will then weight these numbers together to create a ranked list of players in 2021.

For the time being, I will only focus on offensive players.  Kickers and defenses will not be included in this ranked list.

  1. Recent seasons
  2. Rating of WR's
  3. Rating of offensive line
  4. Rating of offensive play caller
